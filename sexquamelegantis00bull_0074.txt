8 EPISTLES.

former war you were inclined towards peace, so now Your
Highness would be prepared to accede to a common and
mutual concord, to the restoration of conquests, after the
example of the other Italian powers, and to the laying
aside of hatreds and revengeful feelingS. We therefore.-
with all the earnestness in our power, exhort Your
Excellency, who have always been accustorned to destroy
the seeds of discords, that, like the other Principalities of
Italy, you should yourself desire to accede to this common
concord, so opportune for thwarting and ruining the
designs of the enemies of the Catholic saith, to lay down
your arms, and to raise the siege of F errara, that renowned
city of the Church; for the execution of which, should

Your Highness give orders as from your singular justice v

and wisdom we trust and hope will be the case, you
will consult the well-being of the Christian community,
and the quietness of all Italy, which is now in very great
peril, and will remove all suspicions of a desire for
domination; and finally, you will achieve praise and
immortal glory among all people. Moreover‚ as His
Highness writes, should there be anything to com—
plain of concerning the Duke aforesaid, besides the right
judgment of the Supreme Pontiss, in which he is little
likely to fail, we promise that we also will lend our
assistance. May Your Excellency fare well.

Given at Rome, the 16th day of December, in the year
of our Lord 1482. Under the signatures of our three
seniors in order.
