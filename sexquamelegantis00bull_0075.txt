EPISTLES. 9

To SIXTUS THE F OURTH, SUPREME PONTIFF.

WE have received the brief of Your Holiness with the
reverence and devotion that were becoming, as we have
always been accustomed to do. We have learned from it
the causes which seem to have urged Your Holiness to
desert our alliance and court peace and alliance with our
common enemies. It exhorts us, moreover, with paterna]
affection and many most polite phrases, to enter into a
peace with the other potentates of Italy, and next to
abandon the war against Ferrara. Truly, Your Beatitude,
we have already through our Ambassador said what we
thought of the peace and alliance concluded with our
common enemies. To repeat this at present does not
appear to us to be worth while ; since such is the decision
of Your Holiness, to whom all laws, divine and human,
on account of your supreme wisdom and incomparable
learning, are very well known. would that they may so
profit Your Holiness and the most Holy See. This, however,
we must declare, namely, that that affair would be no slight
trouble to us, did not our old custom towards all the former
Holy Pontiffs, and especially Your Holiness, admonish us
patiently to bear whatever it may please them to decree,
to rescind, to do, and afterwards to hold as not having
been done; and had we not besides the hope that
God Himself, the Supreme Judge of human affairs, as
with just eyes He beholds these same things, will, with the
arm of His might and justice, not desert us in this trouble,
