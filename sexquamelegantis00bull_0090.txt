24 EPISTLES.

that our admonitions were applied not in the proper time,
the best judge of human actions, but at the end of the war,
after so much expense, after the death of many citizens,
aster the enemy had been besieged. We certainly are
ignorant what new sort of calumny this is that has been
invented, when you say that you had wished for peace
even from the beginning, to which had we exhorted you,
we should easily have obtained anything from you. This
excuse can by no means be received, for that we were
cheated no one will dare deny, who knows the sequel‚
from which your intention towards us before the war,
and your pre-arranged plan of carrying on the war
in Ferrara, are clearer than day. And if you wish to
truly estimate what has been done by us, you will
see indeed that in so far as concerned concord and the
observance of our treaty‚ we both satisfied you by letter,
and osten and long treated with your ambassador; and,
moreover, omitted nothing that we thought would make
for your honour and the quiet os Italy. We were unwilling
to proceed to the censure of a Bull, because you gave a
certain hope of concord and no prospect of making war.
In which hope while we rested, and nevertheless exhorted you
to send us your claims in legal form, you against justice, in
despite of us whom you knew to have a horror of war, alto-
gether without our knowledge, advanced impious arms in
open war against Ferrara. And that you may the more
clearly perceive our intentions towards you and the obser-
vance of our treaty, see what we have suffered through you.
