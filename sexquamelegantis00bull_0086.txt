SIXTUS THE FouRTH, ΡΟΡΕ, To ms BELOVED Sors, THE

NossLE MAN, JOHN MOCEN1G0‚ DOGE OF VENICE,
Health:

WE wrote some days ago, with paterna] love, to Your
Nobility the causes not less just than necessary which
urged us, on behals of the safety of all Italy and of the
Christian commonwealth, to arrange a peace, e-xhorting that
you should accept the same, and withdraw from the
war against Ferrara, which is our city, and that os the
Roman Church, and that you should restore the places
you had occupied ; and we treated with you about this in
the most courteous terms, not using even one word that
could offend either yourself or your honour. But you sent
us a letter in reply written by you in terms far different
from what we hoped that we should read, painting the ·
Ferrarese war with many lying colom-s, and imputing to us
motives which never existed, and never entered into our
mind ; and this has therefore affected us with trouble and
the greatest grief, sor it has shown that your mind and
soul are averse to that peace and alliance which we had
resolved to make among the States of Italy, and that you
vehemently abhor them. We had hoped indeed to be able
as often as we might wish tojudge ofyou exactly as though
you were the most obedient os our sons; and thus when
we had persuaded the other princes or potentates of Italy
to arrange a peace and alliance, we appeared to have so
gained all our desires, that no difficulty or trouble remained
