EPISTLES. 33

Italy. And thus you may consult your own welfare and
the tranquillity of the whole of Italy. Otherwise we shall
not any further conceal that we shall proceed against you
with spiritual and temporal arms, as shall to us seem
expedient, and as justice shall persuade. For that lust of
domination in you is not to be borne; it is too inhuman,
too irreligious, and too unlike a Christian, especially
when it is exhibited towards Christ and His Vicar. We
therefore wish for public peace in Italy, that we may at
the same time guard against the injuries of wars, and at the
same time restore all men to tranquillity, and with the
united strength of the Christian Commonweal take counsel
against our most fierce enemies.

COPY oF A LETTER FROM THE MOST ILLUSTmous
VENETIAN REPUBLIC To OUR MOST HOLY LORD
S1XTus IV„ ΒΥ DIVINE PROVIDENCE PONTIFF.

WE have steadfastly read and modestly what Your
Holiness advises and counsels in your letter. whatever
you have done, after violating the terms of our treaty, and
neglecting both our ancient and recent services to the
Apostolic See, we submit to with a cheerful mind. If the
power of loosing and binding is granted to you, even in a
matter of this kind, it is sufficient for us that it has
happened through no fault of our own, that you deserted us
who with our money, our army and fleet routed that viper
