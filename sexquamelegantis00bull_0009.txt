INTRODUCTION.

T was an agreeable announcement to bibliographers
I that was made in the Times of the 14th of April,
1890, that the British Muscum had acquired for its library
an unique Caxton, namely, the “Sex quam elegantis-
simae Epistolae ’' that passed between Pope Sixtus IV. and
the Venetian Republic‚ with reference to the Duchy of
Ferrara, in the year 1482. This work was first discovered
in the year 1874 in the Hecht-Heine Library at Halberstadt,
bound up in a volume of seventeenth century theological
tracts, by Dr. Konnecke‚ Archivist at Marburg‚ and was by
him described in the Ncner Anzezjgerfi‘ir Bz'hliograplcie for
Oct„ 1874. Afterwards it was described by Mr. Blados in
the second edition of his “ Biography and Typography of
William Caxton‚” London‚ 1882. Some years ago cautious
over-tures were made for its sale, at what was thought
to be an extravagant price, to the authorities of the British
Museum‚ and the purchase was declined. In 1890, how-
ever, it was offered at a considerable reduction of price
to Dr. Garnett, Keeper of the Printed Books, who had no

hesitation in recommending its purchase to the Trustees,
by whom it was acquired for the National Library.
