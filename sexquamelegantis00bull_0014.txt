May, 1482, the Pope and the Republic declared war against
the Duke of F errara, Robert Malatesta being Commander-

minds as to their acquiescence or otherwise in these
arrangements. The Venetians were naturally indignant

replied in a long letter to the Pope on the 7th Jan.,
1483, and on the same day in a short one to the College
