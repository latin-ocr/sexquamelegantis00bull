EPISTLES. 1 1

all fair judgment. Your Holiness is witness, to whom at
the decline of the year we related these injuries. You may
remember how irritating they seemed, how intolerable you
thought them, and were roused even to vengeance in con-
sequence ; but chiefly to attack with arms by land and sea
the enemies of Your Holiness who were in league with the
Duke of Ferrara; with what fidelity therefore, with what
zeal and magnanimity did we enter upon the war for your
dignity and profit, and those of your Holy See. We omit
to speak os the auxiliary forces of horse and foot, as many
as were asked for, most liberally furnished for that purpose
at our cost 3 but most of all, that very strong fleet of almost
eighty triremes and ships furnished with foot and horse must
be mentioned, which, running along the entire coast from
the Abruzzi to Brindisi, laid everything waste with fire and
sword. Then the most noble victory gained by Robert
Malatesta‚ our leader at Nettuno in the Campania over your
enemies, and consecrated to your glory, is commemorated
by eternal monuments in testimony of the same. What
shall we say of our having preferred that Robert should
leave Ferrara, a thing which has never been set down

, to our credit, and with all his troops, by a forced

march, with the greatest possible speed be hurled against
your enemy beyond Campania, as though we forgot
that the forces of all Italy were united against uS, and
that Frederick of Urbino, that most renowned leader, had
pitched his camp against our camp? God favoured our
pious ardour. The enemy was scattered and put to flight
