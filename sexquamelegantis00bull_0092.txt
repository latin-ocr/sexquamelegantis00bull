the war against Ferrara should not be discontinucd, aster

hostile army further. And you immediately withdrew the
sels-same fleet into Ferrara, so that even from this any one

were more fiercely harassed. At length we sent our
Ambassador that with our words he might set forth in
what and how great dangers we were placed, and might
bcg sor Robert with his soldiers. You delayed many days
