besieged within his walls, to exhort us to peace only
means to wrest victory itself from our hands, to yield up
our dominion at the pleasure of our enemies‚ to the
derision of the whole world, and to rouse an enemy
dwelling in the heart os our State from madness to frenzy‚
And since Your Holiness makes mention of the Turks‚ truly
when in that war we were harassed for twenty years, and
bore upon our shoulders the entire weight of the Christian
dangers‚ and when wearied by the duration of the war,
and the very powerful forces and armies of the enemy, we
sought for aid, never did we see Italy combine to assist us,
from a desire for the peace of Italy. But now, so it pleases
God, we are in a worse condition than that Hercule53
while we are worn out, and encounter dangers in the
war, others enjoy peace ; now when the war is coming to an
end, those same persons rush to ἣττης, so that, in truth, we
cannot but suspect that they have not come together
through a love of peace, but have combined through being
alarmed by our victory. , We do not wish to say this
of Your Holiness, who have always had both the honour
of God and the peace and tranquillity of His flock so
much at heart, that on that account you have done many
great things with incredible ardour of mind and charity,
and would do sar more and greater, were it allowed to
Your Holiness by those chiefly who now appear to counsel
peace. Neither do we wish to say this of the most
Reverend Lords the CardinalS, whose most holy intention
and desire sor the common peace of Christians is perspicuous
