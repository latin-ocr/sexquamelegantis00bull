hundred years. Let it be imputed to ambition when what
is not just and reasonable is sought for in war, or when war
is immediately commenced without laying the case before
the other side and giving them a chance ofrepentance. But
what ground for calumny can there be against us, who, as we
have said, have demanded back what was anciently our own,
have called him neighbour, have peacefully exhorted him ?
We put off all recourse to arms for so many years, and
by our mildness we daily made him more obstinate in his
purpose. Those have disturbed the peace of Italy whose
habit it is to disturb it, and who have driven that wretched
Prince, deceived by their promises, to prefer war to peace.
Not we, however, who have omitted nothing by exhorting,
advising, finally praying that he should prefer peace to
war: we predicted, protested that he would pay the penalty
of his solly. For the rest that concerns our course, Your
Excellencies will obtain information from our letter to
the Supreme PontisfÍ¾ from which, we think, there will be
no one of so distorted or malignant a judgment that he
can accuse us of being in the wrong, or of having omitted
anything that becomes the most modest and temperate of
men.
